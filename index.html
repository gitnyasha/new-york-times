        <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
          son and a year’s
          appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
          world of known
          physics.</p>

        <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
          created in the Big
          Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
          in the presumed
          course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
          repulsive force, causing
          the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>

        <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
          pole and not like a
          jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
          Those particles were
          not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>

        <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
        <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
          of the Big Bang, and
          that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

        <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with
          telescopes at the
          South Pole, a team of
          astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples
          in the fabric of
          space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being
          wrenched violently
          apart when it was
          roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
          smoking-gun evidence of
          inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

        <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
          whether it could
          ever be proved.</p>

        <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
          discovery of dark energy
          pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space
          and energy to science
          and speculation.</p>

        <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
          with its hundreds of
          billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture
          and fate are
          unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
          bubbling into frothy
          eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
        <p class="subheading">‘As Big as It Gets’</p>

        <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond
          the reach of
          particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would
          be the first direct
          observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle
          space-time.</p>

        <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>

        <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
          confirmation in his
          lifetime.</p>
        <p>
          “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
        </p>
        <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
          Eschewing email for
          fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.
          Guth, who is now a
          professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that
          night in
          1979), in his
          office last week.</p>

        <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who
          chose
          his words as
          carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>

        <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of
          inflation,
          known as
          chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin
          Kuo, a
          Stanford
          colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a href="#">knocked on his door with a bottle of
            Champagne</a> to tell

        <p> Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
          anything.</p>
        <p>
          “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think
          that we
          ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote
          in an
          email.</p>
        <p>
          Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
          “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
        <p>

          By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
          spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
        <p>
          Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email,
          “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
          discoveries in the history of science.” </p>
        <p>
          John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
          called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
          “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
        <p>
          Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
          that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis,
          said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model,
          but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
        <p>
          Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
          noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the
          cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions
          about the universe. </p>
        <p>
          “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said. </p>
        <p>

          Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
          will report its own findings this year.
          At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements
          from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>

          <b>Spirals in the Sky</b>
        </p>
        <p>

          Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out
          of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally
          by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize. </p>
        <p>

          Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four
          leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes
          at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others
          are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the
          California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The South Pole is the closest
          you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times,
          he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning
          the light waves had a
          slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
          waves, squeezing
          space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of
          polarization of the
          microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little
          arrows going in spirals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of
          the microwaves. The
          group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

          “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
          Harvard supercomputer,
          making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.

          A Special Time
        </p>
        <p>
          The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in
          his Palo Alto house
          35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.

        </p>
        <p>
          Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong
          and weak nuclear
          forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single
          unified force that ruled
          the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
          mythology of gods or
          brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
          splitting away.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was where Dr. Guth came in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32
          degrees, until it is
          disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space
          itself would become
          imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
          universe would blow
          itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the
          harder it pushed
          apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from
          a submicroscopic
          speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of
          normal cosmic
          history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions
          of light-years
          across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but
          the universe might be
          the ultimate free lunch.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
          suggest that
          inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey
          expansion, the rest of
          the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
          multiverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
          deeper into the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
          everything that came
          before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our
          view.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not
          part of the team, “you
          wind up at inflation.”
